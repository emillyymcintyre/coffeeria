Code summary/idea:

Game:
NPC gets a randomly generated menu picking between eight ingredients to go into their coffee
Choices 1-4 are picked twice, and cannot repeat either
Choices 5-8 are more like toppings so they are picked once
The ingredients are displayed one after the other waiting half a second for each

Once the order is assigned the player can chose to move to another area where they then pick out the ingredients to put into the coffee
They also pick a cup color at the end
Depending on what ingredients are chosen the color of the drink and the latte art is different

If any choice is wrong, the only effect on gameplay is they they will receive a red X instead of a green check if they get it correct

So far its simple, however I am planning on adding other details to make it more complicated:

Heating the coffee to a certain temperature that goes back and forth between hot and cold and they have to click at the right moment

Signuature orders(???)

Money system possibly, getting more money for success and less for failure

Using that money to buy decorations, more customers, more drink options ect
